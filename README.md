# LLM-Driven Application Orchestration

A React application demonstrating the power of LLM (Large Language Model) orchestration in modern web applications. This project showcases how LLMs can be used to drive application logic and user interactions in a natural, intuitive way.

## Core Features

### 1. LLM Orchestration
The application uses a custom `useLLMOrchestrator` hook that enables LLM-driven decision making for application actions. This allows for:
- Natural language processing of user intentions
- Automated action dispatching based on LLM understanding
- Flexible state management through LLM interpretation

### 2. Todo Application
A fully functional Todo application that serves as a practical demonstration of LLM orchestration:
- Create new todos through a modal interface
- Toggle todo completion status
- Natural language commands for all actions
- Seamless state management

### 3. LLM Renderer Component
The `<LLMRenderer />` component provides:
- Dynamic content rendering based on LLM processing
- Intelligent interpretation of rendering requirements
- Seamless integration with React components

### 4. LLM Tailwind Integration
The `<LLMTailwind />` component demonstrates:
- Dynamic styling through LLM interpretation
- Automated Tailwind class generation
- Intelligent style application based on context
